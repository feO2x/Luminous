# Root Agents.md

Luminous provides open-source components for document management systems and template management for digital signatures.

## Implementation rules

Plans typically have acceptance criteria with check boxes. Check each box when you are finished with the corresponding criterion.

## General Rules for the Code Base

- Implicit usings or global usings are not allowed - use explicit using statements for clarity.
- This project is not published in a stable version yet, you can make breaking changes.
- `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>` is enabled in Release builds, so your code changes must not generate warnings.
- Prefer `public` over `internal` when designing types. Users of the library should have access to the same APIs as we do. Hide lower level APIs in plain sight, see https://blog.ploeh.dk/2015/09/21/public-types-hidden-in-plain-sight/.

## Code Analysis

- After building the solution, run `dotnet jb inspectcode Luminous.slnx --no-build --swea --properties:Configuration=Release --format=Text --stdout --severity=SUGGESTION --no-updates`. Address or report findings introduced by your changes.

## Here is Your Space

If you encounter something worth noting while you are working on this code base, write it down here in this section. Once you are finished, I will discuss it with you and we can decide where to put your notes.
