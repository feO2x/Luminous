# AGENTS.md for Tests

## General Rules

- Please do not use mocking frameworks like Moq or NSubstitute for test doubles, use hand-crafted test doubles instead.
- Do not write nested test classes. All tests should reside in a class which is directly placed in a namespace.
- Use FluentAssertions instead of xunit's `Assert` class.
- Prefer Sociable Tests instead of Solitary Tests. Create as much test coverage as possible by calling higher level production APIs. Only write solitary tests to cover otherwise unreachable lower level APIs - for example, GuardClauses.
- Keep test coverage at least above 90%.
